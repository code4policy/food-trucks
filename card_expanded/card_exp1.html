            <h3>What makes your truck unique</h3>
            <p>Describe how your products are different from other nearby offerings. You should mention the quality of your ingredients and if your food is culturally diverse. Your products shouldn't compete with any establishments within 100 feet.</p>

          <h3>Operation Plan</h3>
          <p>You should have <a href="https://www.cityofboston.gov/images_documents/Sample%20Operational%20Plan_tcm3-39054.pdf">a plan for the operation of your truck at each site</a>. Your plan needs to include:</p>
           <ul>
            <li>What times you will arrive for setup, open, and leave a site.</li>
            <li>The names of the staff who will work on your truck.</li>
            <li>How you plan to have customers line up for your truck. You need to keep a minimum of four feet of the sidewalk clear.</li>
            <li>Your strategy for keeping other vehicles from parking around your truck. You need to make sure you have 20 feet of clearance in front of and behind your truck.</li>
            <li>Your strategy for keeping the site clean. You should keep a trash can next to your truck, and plan to take all trash with you when you leave. You also must sweep your site and wash the sidewalk â€” if you need to â€” at the end of each shift. Weâ€™ll give you a violation if you dump food in the sewer.</li>
            <li>Where your staff will use the bathroom at each site.</li></ul>
