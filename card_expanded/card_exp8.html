            <h3>Public locations</h3>
            <p>There are 21 public sites for food trucks in the City of Boston. When your food truck permit is approved, we'll let you know when we hold the next public site lottery.<br><br>
              <strong>Zone 1 sites </strong>are high-traffic locations, very competitive, and require a higher fee. These sites are entered into the annual lottery, however, if you drop a site, a mini-lottery will be held for the spot. 
              <br><strong>Zone 2 sites</strong> are in the heart of Boston's vibrant neighborhoods, frequented by local residents and students, and have a three year site permit. The sites are selected on a first-come, first-serve basis. 
              <br><strong>Permit Costs:</strong> We base monthly permit fees on how many shifts you work at each site. You'll have to pay the fee for the number of shifts in each zone that you have. You must pay the total quarterly cost of the license up front. 
              <br><br> For additional details, see <a href =https://www.boston.gov/departments/small-business-development/food-truck-sites>this page</a>.</p>
